ESP8266 WiFi and Voice TV Remote

This project creates a WiFi and Voice capable TV Remote using the ESP8266 chip. The WiFi remote is accessed via a web page on a smart phone. The voice remote is accessed using either Google Home or Amazon's Alexa, which allows you to control the TV with voice commands.

You will need to modify the IR codes to match the TV and/or cable box you are using in the ircodes.h file.
